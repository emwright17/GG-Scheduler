# GG-Scheduler
## Gametime Greatness Fantasy Football Scheduling App


# Background
If you know me, you know I am in a very competitive and engulfing fantasy football league which goes by the name, Gametime Greatness.
We are currently in season 10, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon!

This league keeps our group of friends close year round and makes for some pretty good times, from talking trash on game days to taking trips across the country together, a good
chunk of our lives revolve around this league! So why not make it the best we can? Currently, we go through a lengthy process to determine the order of our yearly draft, and are
very particular about the formation our schedule, which is where the `GG-Scheduler` comes in!

At it's core, this is a simple application that spits out a completed schedule that can be inputted into our league site. Replacing a task that is normally done by hand.

Upon completion, the hope is to use our current system of dividing the league up into tiers, inputting our rivals, and having everything done just as we usually do it, but
without hassle that it usually is year to year. 

Phase 2 of this project would be to work out an interaction with the Yahoo Sports API to import our team names automatically, but this is yet to be confirmed as a possibility with
their API.

# Current Status
Currently, the application is in the earliest stages of development. Feel free to take a look at the `Screenshots` folder to see the current status of the project!
At this time, we have only developed the `Landing` and `Input` views of the application, complete with user inputs for team names. 
Future progress is on the way!
